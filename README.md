This project leverages the power of decision tree in strategic data driven  decision making. It encompasses  the epitome of avid aethesticity and authecity of these machine learning algorithm into factoring uncertainity into analysis. The data is obtained from kaggle; a popular database for dataset 
The data is preprocessed and wrangled systematically and magnanimously to remove unwanted columns and rows
Labelencoding then follows to change all qualitative data to quantative data for machine learning
The model is then trained on the data and so it test samples allocated to gauge its generalization on unseen data
A model of an high as 97.97 accuracy is obtained and ready for prediction
